# RPChess
Welcome to **RPChess**: A variation of Chess based on turn-based combat!

## THE RULES
The game concludes when the enemy's king is killed - simple enough. 

However, you don't go about that with the regular chess rules based on moving and capturing. Instead, each turn is split into a move turn and an attack turn.

### THE MOVE TURN
The move turn works almost exactly as it does in regular Chess. On your move turn, you can move any one of your pieces with the same movement options that they have in
regular Chess. One additional option in the move turn is the ability to ambush: If one of your move spaces has a piece that could be captured, you can sacrifice your
move turn to ambush them, dealing 5 damage. Ambushing spaces are highlighted in yellow.

### THE ATTACK TURN
Here's where the fun begins. After you move a piece or ambush an enemy, you enter your attack turn. In this game, each and every piece has a set of special skills
that they can use to attack the enemy. Whether it be strong attacks to hit nearby enemies, or special spells to heal allies on the battlefield, each piece has a
unique set of specialties that make them important assets to keep alive.

Each piece is kept alive based on an HP basis, and each attack deals a set amount of damage to enemies. When selecting a piece, click one of their skills to view a
description of what it does, as well as what spaces it can affect.
- **Attacks** will highlight all spaces it can affect in gray, and highlight possible attack spaces in red. Click any piece in its range to activate it!
- **Area Attacks** will highlight every space it will affect in dark red. Click any space to activate the skill on every enemy piece in the range!
- **Spells** will highlight viable ally spaces in pink. Click any ally to heal them for the designated HP!
- **The Last Resort** will highlight all allies in red. You should find out what it does in game, though!

Move, attack, and strategize to take down the enemy's monarch in RPChess!
